			<RecruitmentLogistics question="How does recruitment work?" ans="Our recruitment process does not include a typical club application. What is important to us is understanding how you creatively think about and approach solving problems. We accept people from all majors, and we do not require resumes. We care more about you as a person holistically than what is on a piece of paper. Our design challenges are reflective of the impactful projects our members work on each semester."></RecruitmentLogistics>
			<RecruitmentLogistics question="How will Invention Corps operate this semester?" ans="Our club will mainly be operating in-person. The default method for all of our workshops, projects, and socials will be in-person. However, we value the safety and comfort of our members, so we will also make accommodations for anyone who prefers to operate remotely."></RecruitmentLogistics>
